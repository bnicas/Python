ðŸ’³ Credit Card Validator (credit.py)
This Python program checks if a credit card number is valid using Luhnâ€™s Algorithm, and identifies the card type (AMEX, MASTERCARD, or VISA).

How It Works:
Prompts the user to enter a credit card number.

Applies Luhnâ€™s Algorithm to determine if the card number is valid:

Multiply every other digit from the second-to-last by 2.

If the product is two digits, add the digits together.

Sum all the results and add the sum of the digits that werenâ€™t multiplied.

If the total modulo 10 is 0, the number is valid.

Identifies the card type based on:

AMEX: 15 digits, starts with 34 or 37

MASTERCARD: 16 digits, starts with 51â€“55

VISA: 13 or 16 digits, starts with 4

Prints one of the following:

"AMEX"

"MASTERCARD"

"VISA"

"INVALID"
